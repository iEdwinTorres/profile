<div>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">I'm a Software Engineer student at Kenzie Academy.</h2>
    <p>I'm really excited to be here and work towards a career in the tech industry. So far, everyone has been super helpful and kind. I can see already that I will be making life long professional relationships here. And I cant wait to see what the future holds, not just for me, but, for my fellow peers aswell.</p>

<div>
  <h3 style="text-align: center">What are my hobbies and interests?</h3>
    <p>I'm a huge fan of <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>. ( Side Note: D&D &gt Pathfinder. <span style='font-size:17px;'>&#128517;</span>) I've spent hundreds of hours playing with friends and family and it's always a blast. I recommend you look into it because I cannot stress how much fun it is! I also like to thinker around with computers and all sorts of hardware. I like to make small projects for myself that allows me to better use my personal tech, such as performing cable management under my desk and researching the latest and greatest tech gear to get the most out of my MacBook Pro.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center">What I've been doing up until now?</h3>
    <p>After High School I didn't really have much aspirations nor prospects into my future. I had ideas as to what i wanted to do with my life, just no plan nor motivatio to get it into action. I kinda bounced around for a while, some of those things inclued...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Joining the U.S. Army Reserve.</li>
        <li>While also working at Hendrickson Trailer.</li>
        <li>After I exited both the military and Hendrickson after a number of years I...
        <ul>
          <li>Worked at a small machine shop manufacturing aircraft parts.</li>
          <li>Spent several months unemployed due to having to move back home after the end of a long term relationship.</li>
          <li>Then finally getting a job building home brewing equipment at Blichmann Engineering.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally starting at Kenzie Academy</li>
      </ol>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 style="text-align: center">Where I want to go after Kenzie...</h3>
    <p>My dream is to one day work for either Apple or Google as a Software Engineer. I'm a California native and moving back to my home state would be incredible! Though my future income is important, having a fulfilling and rewarding career is what I look most foward to in this field. Coming from working several manual labor jobs, the idea of woriking on a computer doing what I would normally do at home for free, is extreamly attractive to me.</p>

<div>
      <h4style="text-align: center">Just for fun! :)</h4style="text-align:>
      <p>Finally, I would like to share with you a website that I spend (too) much of
      my time on. And that website is
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>. Hope you have as much fun there as I do!</p>
